- Figure out what more tools to use
- Optimize the current tools (For example, Sakshee needs to fix curriculum Tool)
- Make UI more intuitive where you get messages from the system about what the agent is doing instead of just saying "Thinking.."
- make the tool decsriptions better
- clean up and refactor code better. for example, EventsTool has seperate openai call but it can just pull deom utils/openai
